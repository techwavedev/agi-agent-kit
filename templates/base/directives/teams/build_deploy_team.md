# Team Directive: Build & Deploy Team

> **Trigger:** Manual dispatch for CI/CD deployments.

## Team Identity

| Field       | Value                |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Team ID     | `build_deploy_team`  |
| Role        | Compile assets and deploy to cloud |
| Trigger     | Manual trigger via dispatch |
| Mode        | Sequential (deployer depends on compiler's output) |

---

## Goal

Simulate a complex scenario where the first step (compilation) generates a dynamic, unpredictable output directory, and the second step (deployment) must retrieve that exact directory from Qdrant memory to deploy it without conflict.

## Sub-Agents

The team uses these sub-agents in exact order:

### 1. `asset-compiler`

- **Role:** Simulates building a production asset bundle.
- **Action:** Generates a random output directory (e.g., `/tmp/dist_8f9a2b`).
- **Required Output:** MUST return a `handoff_state` object containing the `dist_path` and `build_id`.

### 2. `cloud-deployer`

- **Role:** Simulates uploading the compiled bundle to a cloud provider.
- **Action:** Retrieves the `handoff_state` from the context or Qdrant memory, locates the `dist_path`, and executes the deployment.
- **Required Output:** MUST return a success message verifying the exact `dist_path` it deployed.

---

## Output Contract

The JSON result from this team must confirm the `dist_path` generated by Agent 1 perfectly matches the `deploy_path` processed by Agent 2.
