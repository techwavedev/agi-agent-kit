# Monorepo Management

Build efficient, scalable monorepos that enable code sharing, consistent tooling, and atomic changes across multiple packages and applications.

## Use this skill when

- Setting up new monorepo projects
- Migrating from multi-repo to monorepo
- Optimizing build and test performance
- Managing shared dependencies
- Implementing code sharing strategies
- Setting up CI/CD for monorepos
- Versioning and publishing packages
- Debugging monorepo-specific issues

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to monorepo management
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior design decisions (color palettes, typography, spacing scales) to maintain visual consistency across sessions. Cache generated design tokens.

```bash
# Check for prior frontend/design context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "design system decisions and component patterns for Monorepo Management"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store frontend/design decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Design system: adopted 8px grid, Inter font family, HSL color tokens with dark mode support" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags monorepo-management frontend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share design decisions with backend agents (API contract changes) and QA agents (visual regression baselines).

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented UI components — new design system with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)" \
  --project <project>
```

### Design Memory Persistence

Store design system tokens and component decisions in Qdrant so any agent on any platform (Claude, Gemini, Cursor) can retrieve and apply consistent styling.
