# Theme Factory Skill

This skill provides a curated collection of professional font and color themes themes, each with carefully selected color palettes and font pairings. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.

## Purpose

To apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:
- A cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Usage Instructions

To apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:

1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.
2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck
3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme
4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact

## Themes Available

The following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:

1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme
2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors
3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones
4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale
5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette
6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme
7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones
8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic
9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors
10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones

## Theme Details

Each theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:
- Cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Application Process

After a preferred theme is selected:
1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory
2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck
3. Ensure proper contrast and readability
4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides

## Create your Own Theme
To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior design decisions (color palettes, typography, spacing scales) to maintain visual consistency across sessions. Cache generated design tokens.

```bash
# Check for prior frontend/design context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "design system decisions and component patterns for Theme Factory"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store frontend/design decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Design system: adopted 8px grid, Inter font family, HSL color tokens with dark mode support" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags theme-factory frontend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share design decisions with backend agents (API contract changes) and QA agents (visual regression baselines).

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented UI components — new design system with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)" \
  --project <project>
```

### Design Memory Persistence

Store design system tokens and component decisions in Qdrant so any agent on any platform (Claude, Gemini, Cursor) can retrieve and apply consistent styling.
