# Shopify Apps

## Patterns

### React Router App Setup

Modern Shopify app template with React Router

### Embedded App with App Bridge

Render app embedded in Shopify Admin

### Webhook Handling

Secure webhook processing with HMAC verification

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ REST API for New Apps

### ❌ Webhook Processing Before Response

### ❌ Polling Instead of Webhooks

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Issue | high | ## Respond immediately, process asynchronously |
| Issue | high | ## Check rate limit headers |
| Issue | high | ## Request protected customer data access |
| Issue | medium | ## Use TOML only (recommended) |
| Issue | medium | ## Handle both URL formats |
| Issue | high | ## Use GraphQL for all new code |
| Issue | high | ## Use latest App Bridge via script tag |
| Issue | high | ## Implement all GDPR handlers |

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags shopify-apps <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
