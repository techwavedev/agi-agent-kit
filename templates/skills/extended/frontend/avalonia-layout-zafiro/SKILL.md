# Avalonia Layout with Zafiro.Avalonia

> Master modern, clean, and maintainable Avalonia UI layouts.
> **Focus on semantic containers, shared styles, and minimal XAML.**

## 🎯 Selective Reading Rule

**Read ONLY files relevant to the layout challenge!**

## 📑 Content Map

| File | Description | When to Read |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `themes.md` | Theme organization and shared styles | Setting up or refining app themes |
| `containers.md` | Semantic containers (`HeaderedContainer`, `EdgePanel`, `Card`) | Structuring views and layouts |
| `icons.md` | Icon usage with `IconExtension` and `IconOptions` | Adding and customizing icons |
| `behaviors.md` | `Xaml.Interaction.Behaviors` and avoiding Converters | Implementing complex interactions |
| `components.md` | Generic components and avoiding nesting | Creating reusable UI elements |

## ✅ Checklist for Clean Layouts

- [ ] **Used semantic containers?** (e.g., `HeaderedContainer` instead of `Border` with manual header)
- [ ] **Avoided redundant properties?** Use shared styles in `axaml` files.
- [ ] **Minimized nesting?** Flatten layouts using `EdgePanel` or generic components.
- [ ] **Icons via extension?** Use `{Icon fa-name}` and `IconOptions` for styling.
- [ ] **Behaviors over code-behind?** Use `Interaction.Behaviors` for UI-logic.
- [ ] **Avoided Converters?** Prefer ViewModel properties or Behaviors unless necessary.

---

## ❌ Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Use hardcoded colors or sizes (literals) in views.
- Create deep nesting of `Grid` and `StackPanel`.
- Repeat visual properties across multiple elements (use Styles).
- Use `IValueConverter` for simple logic that belongs in the ViewModel.

**DO:**
- Use `DynamicResource` for colors and brushes.
- Extract repeated layouts into generic components.
- Leverage `Zafiro.Avalonia` specific panels like `EdgePanel` for common UI patterns.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags avalonia-layout-zafiro <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
