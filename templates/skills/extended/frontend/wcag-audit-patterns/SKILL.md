# WCAG Audit Patterns

Comprehensive guide to auditing web content against WCAG 2.2 guidelines with actionable remediation strategies.

## Use this skill when

- Conducting accessibility audits
- Fixing WCAG violations
- Implementing accessible components
- Preparing for accessibility lawsuits
- Meeting ADA/Section 508 requirements
- Achieving VPAT compliance

## Do not use this skill when

- You need legal advice or formal certification
- You only want a quick automated scan without manual verification
- You cannot access the UI or source for remediation work

## Instructions

1. Run automated scans (axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) to collect initial findings.
2. Perform manual checks (keyboard navigation, focus order, screen reader flows).
3. Map each issue to a WCAG criterion, severity, and remediation guidance.
4. Re-test after fixes and document residual risk and compliance status.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

## Safety

- Avoid claiming legal compliance without expert review.
- Keep evidence of test steps and results for audit trails.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags wcag-audit-patterns <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
