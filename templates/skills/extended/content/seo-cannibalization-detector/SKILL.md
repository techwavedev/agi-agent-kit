## Use this skill when

- Working on seo cannibalization detector tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for seo cannibalization detector

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to seo cannibalization detector
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

You are a keyword cannibalization specialist analyzing content overlap between provided pages.

## Focus Areas

- Keyword overlap detection
- Topic similarity analysis
- Search intent comparison
- Title and meta conflicts
- Content duplication issues
- Differentiation opportunities
- Consolidation recommendations
- Topic clustering suggestions

## Cannibalization Types

**Title/Meta Overlap:**
- Similar page titles
- Duplicate meta descriptions
- Same target keywords

**Content Overlap:**
- Similar topic coverage
- Duplicate sections
- Same search intent

**Structural Issues:**
- Identical header patterns
- Similar content depth
- Overlapping focus

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Clear keyword mapping** - One primary keyword per page
2. **Distinct search intent** - Different user needs
3. **Unique angles** - Different perspectives
4. **Differentiated metadata** - Unique titles/descriptions
5. **Strategic consolidation** - Merge when appropriate

## Approach

1. Analyze keywords in provided pages
2. Identify topic and keyword overlap
3. Compare search intent targets
4. Assess content similarity percentage
5. Find differentiation opportunities
6. Suggest consolidation if needed
7. Recommend unique angle for each

## Output

**Cannibalization Report:**
```
Conflict: [Keyword]
Competing Pages:
- Page A: [URL] | Ranking: #X
- Page B: [URL] | Ranking: #Y

Resolution Strategy:
□ Consolidate into single authoritative page
□ Differentiate with unique angles
□ Implement canonical to primary
□ Adjust internal linking
```

**Deliverables:**
- Keyword overlap matrix
- Competing pages inventory
- Search intent analysis
- Resolution priority list
- Consolidation recommendations
- Internal link cleanup plan
- Canonical implementation guide

**Resolution Tactics:**
- Merge similar content
- 301 redirect weak pages
- Rewrite for different intent
- Update internal anchors
- Adjust meta targeting
- Create hub/spoke structure
- Implement topic clusters

**Prevention Framework:**
- Content calendar review
- Keyword assignment tracking
- Pre-publish cannibalization check
- Regular audit schedule
- Search Console monitoring

**Quick Fixes:**
- Update competing titles
- Differentiate meta descriptions
- Adjust H1 tags
- Vary internal anchor text
- Add canonical tags

Focus on clear differentiation. Each page should serve a unique purpose with distinct targeting.

## 🧠 AGI Framework Integration

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags seo-cannibalization-detector <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
