### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags x-article-publisher-skill <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
