# Billing Automation

Master automated billing systems including recurring billing, invoice generation, dunning management, proration, and tax calculation.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing SaaS subscription billing
- Automating invoice generation and delivery
- Managing failed payment recovery (dunning)
- Calculating prorated charges for plan changes
- Handling sales tax, VAT, and GST
- Processing usage-based billing
- Managing billing cycles and renewals

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need a one-off invoice or manual billing
- The task is unrelated to billing or subscriptions
- You cannot change pricing, plans, or billing flows

## Instructions

- Define plans, pricing, billing intervals, and proration rules.
- Map subscription lifecycle states and renewal/cancellation behavior.
- Implement invoicing, payments, retries, and dunning workflows.
- Model taxes and compliance requirements per region.
- Validate with sandbox payments and reconcile ledger outputs.
- If detailed templates are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Do not charge real customers in testing environments.
- Verify tax handling and compliance obligations before production rollout.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags billing-automation <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
