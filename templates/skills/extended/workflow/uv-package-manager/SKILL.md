# UV Package Manager

Comprehensive guide to using uv, an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust, for modern Python project management and dependency workflows.

## Use this skill when

- Setting up new Python projects quickly
- Managing Python dependencies faster than pip
- Creating and managing virtual environments
- Installing Python interpreters
- Resolving dependency conflicts efficiently
- Migrating from pip/pip-tools/poetry
- Speeding up CI/CD pipelines
- Managing monorepo Python projects
- Working with lockfiles for reproducible builds
- Optimizing Docker builds with Python dependencies

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to uv package manager
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags uv-package-manager <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
