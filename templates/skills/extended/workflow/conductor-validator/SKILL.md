description: Validates Conductor project artifacts for completeness,
  consistency, and correctness. Use after setup, when diagnosing issues, or
  before implementation to verify project context.

# Check if conductor directory exists
ls -la conductor/

# Find all track directories
ls -la conductor/tracks/

# Check for required files
ls conductor/index.md conductor/product.md conductor/tech-stack.md conductor/workflow.md conductor/tracks.md
```

## Use this skill when

- Working on check if conductor directory exists tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for check if conductor directory exists

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to check if conductor directory exists
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Pattern Matching

**Status markers in tracks.md:**

```
- [ ] Track Name  # Not started
- [~] Track Name  # In progress
- [x] Track Name  # Complete
```

**Task markers in plan.md:**

```
- [ ] Task description  # Pending
- [~] Task description  # In progress
- [x] Task description  # Complete
```

**Track ID pattern:**

```
<type>_<name>_<YYYYMMDD>
Example: feature_user_auth_20250115
```

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags conductor-validator <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
