## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Scope Definition

#### Define Objectives

- [ ] **Clarify testing purpose** - Determine goals (find vulnerabilities, compliance, customer assurance)
- [ ] **Validate pentest necessity** - Ensure penetration test is the right solution
- [ ] **Align outcomes with objectives** - Define success criteria

**Reference Questions:**
- Why are you doing this pentest?
- What specific outcomes do you expect?
- What will you do with the findings?

#### Know Your Test Types

| Type | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| External Pentest | Assess external attack surface | Public-facing systems |
| Internal Pentest | Assess insider threat risk | Internal network |
| Web Application | Find application vulnerabilities | Specific applications |
| Social Engineering | Test human security | Employees, processes |
| Red Team | Full adversary simulation | Entire organization |

#### Enumerate Likely Threats

- [ ] **Identify high-risk areas** - Where could damage occur?
- [ ] **Assess data sensitivity** - What data could be compromised?
- [ ] **Review legacy systems** - Old systems often have vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Map critical assets** - Prioritize testing targets

#### Define Scope

- [ ] **List in-scope systems** - IPs, domains, applications
- [ ] **Define out-of-scope items** - Systems to avoid
- [ ] **Set testing boundaries** - What techniques are allowed?
- [ ] **Document exclusions** - Third-party systems, production data

#### Budget Planning

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Asset Value | Higher value = higher investment |
| Complexity | More systems = more time |
| Depth Required | Thorough testing costs more |
| Reputation Value | Brand-name firms cost more |

**Budget Reality Check:**
- Cheap pentests often produce poor results
- Align budget with asset criticality
- Consider ongoing vs. one-time testing

### Phase 2: Environment Preparation

#### Prepare Test Environment

- [ ] **Production vs. staging decision** - Determine where to test
- [ ] **Set testing limits** - No DoS on production
- [ ] **Schedule testing window** - Minimize business impact
- [ ] **Create test accounts** - Provide appropriate access levels

**Environment Options:**
```
Production  - Realistic but risky
Staging     - Safer but may differ from production
Clone       - Ideal but resource-intensive
```

#### Run Preliminary Scans

- [ ] **Execute vulnerability scanners** - Find known issues first
- [ ] **Fix obvious vulnerabilities** - Don't waste pentest time
- [ ] **Document existing issues** - Share with testers

**Common Pre-Scan Tools:**
```bash
# Network vulnerability scan
nmap -sV --script vuln TARGET

# Web vulnerability scan
nikto -h http://TARGET
```

#### Review Security Policy

- [ ] **Verify compliance requirements** - GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA
- [ ] **Document data handling rules** - Sensitive data procedures
- [ ] **Confirm legal authorization** - Get written permission

#### Notify Hosting Provider

- [ ] **Check provider policies** - What testing is allowed?
- [ ] **Submit authorization requests** - AWS, Azure, GCP requirements
- [ ] **Document approvals** - Keep records

**Cloud Provider Policies:**
- AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/
- Azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/security/pentest
- GCP: https://cloud.google.com/security/overview

#### Freeze Developments

- [ ] **Stop deployments during testing** - Maintain consistent environment
- [ ] **Document current versions** - Record system states
- [ ] **Avoid critical patches** - Unless security emergency

#### Define Methodology

- [ ] **Select testing standard** - PTES, OWASP, NIST
- [ ] **Determine access level** - Black box, gray box, white box
- [ ] **Agree on techniques** - Manual vs. automated testing
- [ ] **Set communication schedule** - Updates and escalation

**Testing Approaches:**

| Type | Access Level | Simulates |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Black Box | No information | External attacker |
| Gray Box | Partial access | Insider with limited access |
| White Box | Full access | Insider/detailed audit |

#### Define Report Format

- [ ] **Review sample reports** - Ensure quality meets needs
- [ ] **Specify required sections** - Executive summary, technical details
- [ ] **Request machine-readable output** - CSV, XML for tracking
- [ ] **Agree on risk ratings** - CVSS, custom scale

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags Pentest Checklist <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
