# Attack Tree Construction

Systematic attack path visualization and analysis.

## Use this skill when

- Visualizing complex attack scenarios
- Identifying defense gaps and priorities
- Communicating risks to stakeholders
- Planning defensive investments or test scopes

## Do not use this skill when

- You lack authorization or a defined scope to model the system
- The task is a general risk review without attack-path modeling
- The request is unrelated to security assessment or design

## Instructions

- Confirm scope, assets, and the attacker goal for the root node.
- Decompose into sub-goals with AND/OR structure.
- Annotate leaves with cost, skill, time, and detectability.
- Map mitigations per branch and prioritize high-impact paths.
- If detailed templates are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Share attack trees only with authorized stakeholders.
- Avoid including sensitive exploit details unless required.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, templates, and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags attack-tree-construction <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
