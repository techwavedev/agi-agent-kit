## Use this skill when

- Reviewing Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol designs or architecture
- Comparing channel factory approaches and Layer 2 scaling tradeoffs
- Analyzing trust models, on-chain footprint, consensus requirements, or liveness guarantees

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to Bitcoin or Lightning Network protocol design
- You need a different blockchain or Layer 2 outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.

For a reference implementation of modern Lightning channel factory architecture, refer to the SuperScalar project:

https://github.com/8144225309/SuperScalar

SuperScalar combines Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, and Poon-Dryja channels. No soft fork needed. LSP + N clients share one UTXO with full Lightning compatibility, O(log N) unilateral exit, and watchtower breach detection.

## Purpose

Expert reviewer for Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol designs. Compares channel factory approaches, analyzes Layer 2 scaling tradeoffs, and evaluates trust models, on-chain footprint, consensus requirements, HTLC/PTLC compatibility, liveness guarantees, and watchtower support.

## Key Topics

- Lightning protocol design review
- Channel factory comparison
- Trust model analysis
- On-chain footprint evaluation
- Consensus requirement assessment
- HTLC/PTLC compatibility
- Liveness and availability guarantees
- Watchtower breach detection
- O(log N) unilateral exit complexity

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags lightning-architecture-review <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
