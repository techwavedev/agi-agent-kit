# FDA MedTech Compliance Auditor

## Overview

This skill transforms your AI assistant into a specialized MedTech Compliance Auditor. It focuses on Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and traditional medical equipment regulations, including 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation), IEC 62304 (Software Lifecycle), ISO 13485, and ISO 14971 (Risk Management).

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when reviewing Software Validation Protocols for Medical Devices.
- Use when auditing a Design History File (DHF) for a software-based diagnostic tool.
- Use when ensuring IT infrastructure meets 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records.
- Use when preparing a CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) for a software defect.

## How It Works

1. **Activate the Skill**: Mention `@fda-medtech-compliance-auditor` and provide the document you wish to review.
2. **Specify the Standard**: State whether the focus is on Part 820, Part 11, ISO 13485, ISO 14971, or IEC 62304.
3. **Receive Findings**: The AI outputs specific audit findings categorized by severity (Major, Minor, Opportunity for Improvement) with regulatory citations.
4. **Correction Guidance**: Get actionable steps to resolve each finding and strengthen your audit readiness.

## Examples

### Example 1: CAPA Root Cause Review

**Scenario:** A CAPA was opened for a software defect in a Class II device. The documented root cause is “developer error — unclear requirements.” The corrective action is developer retraining.

**Finding:**

```text
FDA AUDIT FINDING
Severity: Major
Citation: 21 CFR 820.100(a)(2) / IEC 62304 Section 5.1

Analysis:
"Developer error" is a symptom, not a root cause. Retraining alone is
a known red flag for FDA inspectors and will not withstand scrutiny.
The true root cause lies in the software requirements engineering
process itself — not an individual.

Required Actions:
1. Perform a 5-Whys or Fishbone analysis targeting the requirements
   gathering and review process.
2. Update the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) and the
   corresponding process SOP.
3. Document an effectiveness check with a measurable criterion
   (e.g., zero requirements-related defects in next 3 releases).
4. Do not close the CAPA on retraining alone.
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Provide exact wording from SOPs, risk tables, or validation plans for the most accurate review.
- ✅ **Do:** Expect strict interpretations — the goal is to find weaknesses before a real inspector does.
- ❌ **Don't:** Forget to link every software defect to a clinical risk item in your ISO 14971 risk file.
- ❌ **Don't:** Assume "we tested it and it works" satisfies IEC 62304 software verification requirements.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags fda-medtech-compliance-auditor <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
