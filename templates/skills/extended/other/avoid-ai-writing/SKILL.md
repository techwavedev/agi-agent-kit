# Avoid AI Writing — Audit & Rewrite

Detects and fixes AI writing patterns ("AI-isms") that make text sound machine-generated. Covers 21 pattern categories with a 43-entry word/phrase replacement table that maps each flagged term to a specific, plainer alternative.

## When to Use This Skill

- When asked to "remove AI-isms," "clean up AI writing," or "make this sound less like AI"
- After drafting content with AI and before publishing
- When editing any text that sounds like it was generated rather than written
- When auditing documentation, blog posts, marketing copy, or internal communications for AI tells

## What It Detects

**21 pattern categories:** formatting issues (em dashes, bold overuse, emoji headers, bullet-heavy sections), sentence structure problems (hedging, hollow intensifiers, rule of three), word/phrase replacements (43 entries like leverage→use, utilize→use, robust→reliable), template phrases, transition phrases, structural issues, significance inflation, copula avoidance, synonym cycling, vague attributions, filler phrases, generic conclusions, chatbot artifacts, notability name-dropping, superficial -ing analyses, promotional language, formulaic challenges, false ranges, inline-header lists, title case headings, and cutoff disclaimers.

## Example

**Prompt:**
```
Audit this for AI writing patterns:

"In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, developers are embarking on a pivotal journey to leverage cutting-edge tools that streamline their workflows. Moreover, these robust solutions serve as a testament to the industry's commitment to fostering seamless experiences."
```

**Output:** The skill returns four sections:
1. **Issues found** — every AI-ism quoted (landscape, embarking, pivotal, leverage, cutting-edge, streamline, robust, serves as, testament to, fostering, seamless, Moreover, In today's rapidly evolving...)
2. **Rewritten version** — "Developers are starting to use newer AI tools to simplify their work. These tools are reliable, and they're making development less painful."
3. **What changed** — summary of edits
4. **Second-pass audit** — re-reads the rewrite to catch any surviving tells

## Limitations

- Does not detect AI-generated code, only prose
- Pattern matching is guideline-based, not absolute — some flagged words are fine in context
- The replacement table suggests alternatives but the best choice depends on context
- Cannot verify factual claims or find real citations to replace vague attributions

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags avoid-ai-writing <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
