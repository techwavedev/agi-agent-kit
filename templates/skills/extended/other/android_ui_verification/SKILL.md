# Android UI Verification Skill

This skill provides a systematic approach to testing React Native applications on an Android emulator using ADB commands. It allows for autonomous interaction, state verification, and visual regression checking.

## When to Use
- Verifying UI changes in React Native or Native Android apps.
- Autonomous debugging of layout issues or interaction bugs.
- Ensuring feature functionality when manual testing is too slow.
- Capturing automated screenshots for PR documentation.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Android Emulator running.
- `adb` installed and in PATH.
- Application in debug mode for logcat access.

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Device Calibration
Before interacting, always verify the screen resolution to ensure tap coordinates are accurate.
```bash
adb shell wm size
```
*Note: Layouts are often scaled. Use the physical size returned as the base for coordinate calculations.*

### 2. UI Inspection (State Discovery)
Use the `uiautomator` dump to find the exact bounds of UI elements (buttons, inputs).
```bash
adb shell uiautomator dump /sdcard/view.xml && adb pull /sdcard/view.xml ./artifacts/view.xml
```
Search the `view.xml` for `text`, `content-desc`, or `resource-id`. The `bounds` attribute `[x1,y1][x2,y2]` defines the clickable area.

### 3. Interaction Commands
- **Tap**: `adb shell input tap <x> <y>` (Use the center of the element bounds).
- **Swipe**: `adb shell input swipe <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <duration_ms>` (Used for scrolling).
- **Text Input**: `adb shell input text "<message>"` (Note: Limited support for special characters).
- **Key Events**: `adb shell input keyevent <code_id>` (e.g., 66 for Enter).

### 4. Verification & Reporting
#### Visual Verification
Capture a screenshot after interaction to confirm UI changes.
```bash
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screen.png && adb pull /sdcard/screen.png ./artifacts/test_result.png
```

#### Analytical Verification
Monitor the JS console logs in real-time to detect errors or log successes.
```bash
adb logcat -d | grep "ReactNativeJS" | tail -n 20
```

#### Cleanup
Always store generated files in the `artifacts/` folder to satisfy project organization rules.

## 💡 Best Practices
- **Wait for Animations**: Always add a short sleep (e.g., 1-2s) between interaction and verification.
- **Center Taps**: Calculate the arithmetic mean of `[x1,y1][x2,y2]` for the most reliable tap target.
- **Log Markers**: Use distinct log messages in the code (e.g., `✅ Action Successful`) to make `grep` verification easy.
- **Fail Fast**: If a `uiautomator dump` fails or doesn't find the expected text, stop and troubleshoot rather than blind-tapping.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags android_ui_verification <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
