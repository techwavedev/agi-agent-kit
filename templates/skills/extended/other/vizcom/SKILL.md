# Vizcom Skill

[Vizcom](https://vizcom.com/) is an AI-driven platform designed to accelerate the ideation and rendering process, turning rough inputs into breathtaking visualizations.

## Context

Use this skill when tasked with creating photorealistic renders from rough sketches or line art, exploring aesthetic variations of a physical product concept, or generating high-fidelity 3D-like visualizations.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when:

- Designing physical products (furniture, electronics, transportation, consumer goods).
- A user provides a sketch or a description of a product and needs a professional, awe-inspiring render.
- Generating "mood" or "concept" imagery for hardware or tangible UI projects.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Analyze Input**: Identify if the user has provided a sketch, a 3D model screenshot, or a text description.
2. **Define Style**: Choose a specific **Render Style** (e.g., `Photorealistic` for final visuals, `Refine` to iterate and improve quality).
3. **Draft Premium Prompt**: Formulate precise prompts. Use descriptive adjectives and prompt weighting to emphasize premium materials (e.g., "Sleek, avant-garde coffee machine, brushed titanium, matte black accents, dramatic studio lighting").
4. **Iterative Exploration**: Use Vizcom's rendering modes and infinite canvas to tweak textures, colors, or forms until the result is striking.
5. **Finalize**: Present the high-fidelity render.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning designs. DO NOT build in common or generic styles. Avoid safe, boring product shapes.
- **Material Precision**: Always specify rich textures (e.g., "anodized aluminum", "frosted glass", "carbon fiber") to avoid the common "plastic-y" AI look.
- **Lighting is Key**: Always include lighting directions in the prompt (e.g., "cinematic lighting", "high contrast shadows") to elevate the visual impact.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior design decisions (color palettes, typography, spacing scales) to maintain visual consistency across sessions. Cache generated design tokens.

```bash
# Check for prior frontend/design context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "design system decisions and component patterns for Vizcom"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store frontend/design decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Design system: adopted 8px grid, Inter font family, HSL color tokens with dark mode support" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags vizcom frontend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share design decisions with backend agents (API contract changes) and QA agents (visual regression baselines).

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented UI components — new design system with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)" \
  --project <project>
```

### Design Memory Persistence

Store design system tokens and component decisions in Qdrant so any agent on any platform (Claude, Gemini, Cursor) can retrieve and apply consistent styling.
