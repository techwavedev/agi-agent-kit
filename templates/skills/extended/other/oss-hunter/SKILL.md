# OSS Hunter 🎯

A precision skill for agents to find, analyze, and strategize for high-impact Open Source contributions. This skill helps you become a top-tier contributor by identifying the most "mergeable" and influential issues in trending repositories.

## When to Use

- Use when the user asks to find open source issues to work on.
- Use when searching for "help wanted" or "good first issue" tasks in specific domains like AI or Web3.
- Use to generate a "Contribution Dossier" with ready-to-execute strategies for trending projects.

## Quick Start

Ask your agent:
- "Find me some help-wanted issues in trending AI repositories."
- "Hunt for bug fixes in langchain-ai/langchain that are suitable for a quick PR."
- "Generate a contribution dossier for the most recent trending projects on GitHub."

## Workflow

When hunting for contributions, the agent follows this multi-stage protocol:

### Phase 1: Repository Discovery
Use `web_search` or `gh api` to find trending repositories.
Focus on:
- Stars > 1000
- Recent activity (pushed within 24 hours)
- Relevant topics (AI, Agentic, Web3, Tooling)

### Phase 2: Issue Extraction
Search for specific labels:
- `help-wanted`
- `good-first-issue`
- `bug`
- `v1` / `roadmap`

```bash
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --label "help wanted" --limit 10
```

### Phase 3: Feasibility Analysis
Analyze the issue:
1. **Reproducibility**: Is there a code snippet to reproduce the bug?
2. **Impact**: How many users does this affect?
3. **Mergeability**: Check recent PR history. Does the maintainer merge community PRs quickly?
4. **Complexity**: Can this be solved by an agent with the current tools?

### Phase 4: The Dossier
Generate a structured report for the human:
- **Project Name & Stars**
- **Issue Link & Description**
- **Root Cause Analysis** (based on code inspection)
- **Proposed Fix Strategy**
- **Confidence Score** (1-10)

## Limitations

- Accuracy depends on the availability of `gh` CLI or `web_search` tools.
- Analysis is limited by context window when reading very large repositories.
- Cannot guarantee PR acceptance (maintainer discretion).

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags oss-hunter <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
