# Anime.js Animation Skill

[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) is a lightweight but extremely powerful JavaScript animation engine. It excels at complex timelines, staggering, and precise control over DOM, CSS, and SVGs.

## Context

This skill is used for creating high-fidelity, jaw-dropping web animations that go far beyond simple CSS transitions. It's the tool of choice for awards-caliber interactive sites.

## When to Use
Trigger this skill when:

- Creating complex, multi-stage landing page orchestrations.
- Implementing staggered animations for revealing grids, text, or data visualizations.
- Animating SVG paths (morphing shapes, drawing dynamic lines).
- Building highly interactive, kinetic UI elements that respond fluidly to user input.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Identify Targets**: Select the DOM elements or SVGs to be animated.
2. **Define Properties & Easing**: Specify values to animate. **Crucially**, utilize advanced easing functions (e.g., custom `cubicBezier`, `spring`, or `elastic`) instead of basic `linear` or `ease-in-out` to make the motion feel expensive and natural.
3. **Orchestrate Timelines**: Use `anime.timeline()` to sequence complex choreography. Master the use of timeline offsets (relative `'-=200'` vs absolute) to create seamless overlapping motion.
4. **Implement**:
   ```javascript
   const tl = anime.timeline({
     easing: "spring(1, 80, 10, 0)",
     duration: 1000,
   });
   tl.add({
     targets: ".hero-text",
     translateY: [50, 0],
     opacity: [0, 1],
     delay: anime.stagger(100),
   }).add(
     { targets: ".hero-image", scale: [0.9, 1], opacity: [0, 1] },
     "-=800",
   );
   ```

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build common, boring transitions. Every animation should feel bespoke, fluid, and heavily polished.
- **Staggering**: Leverage `anime.stagger()` extensively to add organic rhythm to multiple elements.
- **Performance**: Monitor main thread usage; use `will-change: transform, opacity` where appropriate for GPU acceleration.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior decisions and patterns to avoid re-discovering solutions. Cache results for instant retrieval in future sessions.

```bash
# Check for prior development context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "prior work and patterns related to Animejs Animation"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store development decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Completed task with key insights documented for future reference" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags animejs-animation default
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share outcomes with other agents so the team stays aligned and avoids duplicate work.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Task completed — results documented and shared with team" \
  --project <project>
```
