# FDA Food Safety Auditor

## Overview

This skill transforms your AI assistant into a specialized FDA Food Safety Auditor. It is designed to review Food Safety Plans, HARPC (Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls) documentation, and HACCP plans against the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) standards.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when auditing a Food Safety Plan for a manufacturing or processing facility.
- Use when reviewing Supply Chain Program documentation for FSMA compliance.
- Use when preparing for a routine FDA food facility inspection.
- Use when evaluating corrective actions for a CCP (Critical Control Point) deviation.

## How It Works

1. **Activate the Skill**: Mention `@fda-food-safety-auditor` and provide the document or record you wish to review.
2. **Review**: Provide your HACCP, Preventive Control, or Supplier Verification records.
3. **Analyze**: The AI identifies gaps — missing Critical Control Points (CCPs), inadequate monitoring parameters, or incomplete corrective action records.
4. **Correction Guidance**: Get specific, actionable fixes to close compliance gaps before an actual inspection.

## Examples

### Example 1: CCP Deviation Review

**Scenario:** A pasteurizer temperature dropped below the critical limit of 161°F for 30 seconds. The operator brought it back up and logged “fixed temperature.” No product was quarantined.

**Finding:**

```text
FDA AUDIT FINDING
Severity: Major / Critical
Citation: 21 CFR 117.150 — Corrective Actions and Corrections

Analysis:
The deviation log is inadequate. Dropping below a critical limit means
the product may be unsafe. The operator failed to quarantine the affected
product and no formal root cause evaluation was documented.

Required Actions:
1. Place all product produced during the deviation window on hold.
2. Conduct a risk assessment to determine product disposition.
3. Document a formal Corrective Action identifying the root cause
   (e.g., valve failure, calibration drift).
4. Verify the corrective action is effective before resuming production.
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Provide exact monitoring logs with temperatures, pH values, or times.
- ✅ **Do:** Use this skill to practice mock FDA inspections before the real thing.
- ❌ **Don't:** Assume SSOPs (Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures) satisfy the same requirements as process preventive controls.
- ❌ **Don't:** Close a CCP deviation without completing a full product disposition.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags fda-food-safety-auditor <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
