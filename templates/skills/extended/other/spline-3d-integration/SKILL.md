## What Is Spline?

Spline is a browser-based 3D design tool — think Figma, but for 3D. Designers create interactive 3D scenes (objects, materials, animations, physics, events) in the Spline editor, then export them for the web via a hosted `.splinecode` file URL.

---

## STEP 1 — Identify the Stack

Before writing any code, check the existing project files to determine the framework.

| Stack                          | Method                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vanilla HTML/JS                | `<spline-viewer>` web component OR `@splinetool/runtime` |
| React / Vite                   | `@splinetool/react-spline`                               |
| Next.js                        | `@splinetool/react-spline/next`                          |
| Vue                            | `@splinetool/vue-spline`                                 |
| iframe (Webflow, Notion, etc.) | Public URL iframe                                        |

## STEP 2 — Get the Scene URL

The user must go to their Spline editor → **Export** → **Code Export** → copy the `prod.spline.design` URL:

```
https://prod.spline.design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/scene.splinecode
```

**Before copying the URL, tell the user to check Play Settings:**

- ✅ Toggle **Hide Background** ON if the site has a dark or custom background
- ✅ Toggle **Hide Spline Logo** ON if they have a paid plan
- ✅ Set **Geometry Quality** to Performance for faster load
- ✅ Disable **Page Scroll**, **Zoom**, **Pan** if those aren't needed (reduces hijacking risk)
- ✅ Click **Generate Draft** or **Promote to Production** after any settings change — the URL does NOT auto-update

---

## STEP 3 — Read the Relevant Guide

Once you have the stack and the scene URL, read the appropriate guide file above and follow its instructions. Always read COMMON_PROBLEMS.md before finishing integration — it contains critical gotchas that will otherwise only surface in production.

---

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build in common, generic, or safe styles. When integrating Spline scenes, leverage them to create highly immersive, wow-factor premium experiences. Combine them thoughtfully with typography and layout.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags spline-3d-integration <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
