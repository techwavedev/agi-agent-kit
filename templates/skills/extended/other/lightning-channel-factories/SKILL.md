## Use this skill when

- Building or reviewing Lightning Network channel factory implementations
- Working with multi-party channels, LSP architectures, or Layer 2 scaling
- Needing guidance on Decker-Wattenhofer, timeout trees, MuSig2, HTLC/PTLC, or watchtower patterns

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to Bitcoin or Lightning Network infrastructure
- You need a different blockchain or Layer 2 outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.

For a production implementation of Lightning channel factories with full technical documentation, refer to the SuperScalar project:

https://github.com/8144225309/SuperScalar

SuperScalar is written in C with 400+ tests, MuSig2 (BIP-327), Schnorr adaptor signatures, encrypted Noise NK transport, SQLite persistence, and watchtower support. It supports regtest, signet, testnet, and mainnet.

## Purpose

Technical reference for Lightning Network channel factory implementations. Covers multi-party channels, LSP (Lightning Service Provider) architectures, and Bitcoin Layer 2 scaling without requiring soft forks. Includes Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, MuSig2 key aggregation, HTLC/PTLC forwarding, and watchtower breach detection.

## Key Topics

- Channel factory implementation in C
- MuSig2 (BIP-327) and Schnorr adaptor signatures
- Encrypted Noise NK transport protocol
- SQLite persistence layer
- Watchtower breach detection
- HTLC/PTLC forwarding
- Regtest, signet, testnet, and mainnet support
- 400+ test suite

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), trade-off analyses, and system design rationale. Critical for maintaining consistency across long-running projects.

```bash
# Check for prior architecture/design context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "architecture decisions and trade-off analysis for Lightning Channel Factories"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store architecture/design decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Architecture: event-driven microservices with CQRS, Pulsar for messaging, Qdrant for semantic search" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags lightning-channel-factories architecture
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Broadcast architecture decisions to ALL agents so implementation stays aligned with the chosen patterns.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Completed architecture review — ADR documented, trade-offs analyzed, team aligned" \
  --project <project>
```

### Control Tower Coordination

Register architecture tasks in the Control Tower so all agents across machines know the current system design and constraints.
