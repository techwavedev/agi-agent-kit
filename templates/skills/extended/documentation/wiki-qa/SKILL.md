# Wiki Q&A

Answer repository questions grounded entirely in source code evidence.

## When to Activate

- User asks a question about the codebase
- User wants to understand a specific file, function, or component
- User asks "how does X work" or "where is Y defined"

## Procedure

1. Detect the language of the question; respond in the same language
2. Search the codebase for relevant files
3. Read those files to gather evidence
4. Synthesize an answer with inline citations

## Response Format

- Use `##` headings, code blocks with language tags, tables, bullet lists
- Cite sources inline: `(src/path/file.ts:42)`
- Include a "Key Files" table mapping files to their roles
- If information is insufficient, say so and suggest files to examine

## Rules

- ONLY use information from actual source files
- NEVER invent, guess, or use external knowledge
- Think step by step before answering

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior documentation structure and content to maintain consistency. Cache generated docs to avoid regenerating unchanged sections.

```bash
# Check for prior documentation context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "documentation patterns and prior content for Wiki Qa"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store documentation decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Documentation: API reference generated from OpenAPI spec, deployment guide updated with new env vars" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags wiki-qa documentation
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share documentation changes with all agents so they reference the latest guides and APIs.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Documentation updated — API reference, deployment guide, and CHANGELOG all current" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Documentation

This skill pairs with `documentation_team` — dispatched automatically after any code change to keep docs in sync.
