# Modern JavaScript Patterns

Comprehensive guide for mastering modern JavaScript (ES6+) features, functional programming patterns, and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and performant code.

## Use this skill when

- Refactoring legacy JavaScript to modern syntax
- Implementing functional programming patterns
- Optimizing JavaScript performance
- Writing maintainable and readable code
- Working with asynchronous operations
- Building modern web applications
- Migrating from callbacks to Promises/async-await
- Implementing data transformation pipelines

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to modern javascript patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags modern-javascript-patterns <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
