# Rust Async Patterns

Production patterns for async Rust programming with Tokio runtime, including tasks, channels, streams, and error handling.

## Use this skill when

- Building async Rust applications
- Implementing concurrent network services
- Using Tokio for async I/O
- Handling async errors properly
- Debugging async code issues
- Optimizing async performance

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to rust async patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), trade-off analyses, and system design rationale. Critical for maintaining consistency across long-running projects.

```bash
# Check for prior architecture/design context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "architecture decisions and trade-off analysis for Rust Async Patterns"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store architecture/design decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Architecture: event-driven microservices with CQRS, Pulsar for messaging, Qdrant for semantic search" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags rust-async-patterns architecture
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Broadcast architecture decisions to ALL agents so implementation stays aligned with the chosen patterns.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Completed architecture review — ADR documented, trade-offs analyzed, team aligned" \
  --project <project>
```

### Control Tower Coordination

Register architecture tasks in the Control Tower so all agents across machines know the current system design and constraints.
