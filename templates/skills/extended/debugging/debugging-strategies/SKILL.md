# Debugging Strategies

Transform debugging from frustrating guesswork into systematic problem-solving with proven strategies, powerful tools, and methodical approaches.

## Use this skill when

- Tracking down elusive bugs
- Investigating performance issues
- Debugging production incidents
- Analyzing crash dumps or stack traces
- Debugging distributed systems

## Do not use this skill when

- There is no reproducible issue or observable symptom
- The task is purely feature development
- You cannot access logs, traces, or runtime signals

## Instructions

- Reproduce the issue and capture logs, traces, and environment details.
- Form hypotheses and design controlled experiments.
- Narrow scope with binary search and targeted instrumentation.
- Document findings and verify the fix.
- If detailed playbooks are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed debugging patterns and checklists.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags debugging-strategies <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
