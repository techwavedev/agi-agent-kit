# Data Quality Frameworks

Production patterns for implementing data quality with Great Expectations, dbt tests, and data contracts to ensure reliable data pipelines.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing data quality checks in pipelines
- Setting up Great Expectations validation
- Building comprehensive dbt test suites
- Establishing data contracts between teams
- Monitoring data quality metrics
- Automating data validation in CI/CD

## Do not use this skill when

- The data sources are undefined or unavailable
- You cannot modify validation rules or schemas
- The task is unrelated to data quality or contracts

## Instructions

- Identify critical datasets and quality dimensions.
- Define expectations/tests and contract rules.
- Automate validation in CI/CD and schedule checks.
- Set alerting, ownership, and remediation steps.
- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Avoid blocking critical pipelines without a fallback plan.
- Handle sensitive data securely in validation outputs.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed frameworks, templates, and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags data-quality-frameworks <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
