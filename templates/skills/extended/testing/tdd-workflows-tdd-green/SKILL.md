# Green Phase: Simple function
def product_list(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    return JsonResponse({'products': list(products.values())})

# Refactor: Class-based view
class ProductListView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        products = Product.objects.all()
        return JsonResponse({'products': list(products.values())})

# Refactor: Generic view
class ProductListView(ListView):
    model = Product
    context_object_name = 'products'
```

### Express Patterns

**Inline → Middleware → Service Layer:**
```javascript
// Green Phase: Inline logic
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = { id: Date.now(), ...req.body };
  users.push(user);
  res.json(user);
});

// Refactor: Extract middleware
app.post('/api/users', validateUser, (req, res) => {
  const user = userService.create(req.body);
  res.json(user);
});

// Refactor: Full layering
app.post('/api/users',
  validateUser,
  asyncHandler(userController.create)
);
```

## Use this skill when

- Moving from red to green in a TDD cycle
- Implementing minimal behavior to satisfy tests
- You want to keep implementation intentionally simple

## Do not use this skill when

- You are refactoring for design or performance
- Tests are already passing and you need new requirements
- You need a full architectural redesign

## Instructions

1. Review failing tests and identify the smallest fix.
2. Implement the minimal change to pass the next test.
3. Run tests after each change to confirm progress.
4. Record shortcuts or debt for the refactor phase.

## Safety

- Avoid bypassing tests to make them pass.
- Keep changes scoped to the failing behavior only.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags tdd-workflows-tdd-green <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
