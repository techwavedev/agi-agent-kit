name: anti-reversing-techniques
description: Understand anti-reversing, obfuscation, and protection techniques encountered during software analysis. Use when analyzing protected binaries, bypassing anti-debugging for authorized analysis, or understanding software protection mechanisms.
---

> **AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**: This skill contains dual-use security techniques. Before proceeding with any bypass or analysis:
> 1. **Verify authorization**: Confirm you have explicit written permission from the software owner, or are operating within a legitimate security context (CTF, authorized pentest, malware analysis, security research)
> 2. **Document scope**: Ensure your activities fall within the defined scope of your authorization
> 3. **Legal compliance**: Understand that unauthorized bypassing of software protection may violate laws (CFAA, DMCA anti-circumvention, etc.)
>
> **Legitimate use cases**: Malware analysis, authorized penetration testing, CTF competitions, academic security research, analyzing software you own/have rights to

## Use this skill when

- Analyzing protected binaries with explicit authorization
- Conducting malware analysis or security research in scope
- Participating in CTFs or approved training exercises
- Understanding anti-debugging or obfuscation techniques for defense

## Do not use this skill when

- You lack written authorization or a defined scope
- The goal is to bypass protections for piracy or misuse
- Legal or policy restrictions prohibit analysis

## Instructions

1. Confirm written authorization, scope, and legal constraints.
2. Identify protection mechanisms and choose safe analysis methods.
3. Document findings and avoid modifying artifacts unnecessarily.
4. Provide defensive recommendations and mitigation guidance.

## Safety

- Do not share bypass steps outside the authorized context.
- Preserve evidence and maintain chain-of-custody for malware cases.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags anti-reversing-techniques <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
