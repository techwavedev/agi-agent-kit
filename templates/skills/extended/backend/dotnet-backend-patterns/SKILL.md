# .NET Backend Development Patterns

Master C#/.NET patterns for building production-grade APIs, MCP servers, and enterprise backends with modern best practices (2024/2025).

## Use this skill when

- Developing new .NET Web APIs or MCP servers
- Reviewing C# code for quality and performance
- Designing service architectures with dependency injection
- Implementing caching strategies with Redis
- Writing unit and integration tests
- Optimizing database access with EF Core or Dapper
- Configuring applications with IOptions pattern
- Handling errors and implementing resilience patterns

## Do not use this skill when

- The project is not using .NET or C#
- You only need frontend or client guidance
- The task is unrelated to backend architecture

## Instructions

- Define architecture boundaries, modules, and layering.
- Apply DI, async patterns, and resilience strategies.
- Validate data access performance and caching.
- Add tests and observability for critical flows.
- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed .NET patterns and examples.

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags dotnet-backend-patterns <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
