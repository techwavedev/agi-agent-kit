# Neon Postgres

## Patterns

### Prisma with Neon Connection

Configure Prisma for Neon with connection pooling.

Use two connection strings:
- DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client
- DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate

The pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections.
Direct connection required for migrations (DDL operations).


### Drizzle with Neon Serverless Driver

Use Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless HTTP driver for
edge/serverless environments.

Two driver options:
- neon-http: Single queries over HTTP (fastest for one-off queries)
- neon-serverless: WebSocket for transactions and sessions


### Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

Neon provides built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer.

Key limits:
- Up to 10,000 concurrent connections to pooler
- Connections still consume underlying Postgres connections
- 7 connections reserved for Neon superuser

Use pooled endpoint for application, direct for migrations.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior API design decisions, database schema choices, and error handling patterns. Cache API response templates for consistent error formatting.

```bash
# Check for prior backend/API context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "API design patterns and architecture decisions for Neon Postgres"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store backend/API decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "API architecture: REST with HATEOAS, JWT auth, rate limiting at 100 req/min per tenant" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags neon-postgres backend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with frontend agents so they update their client code, and with QA agents for test coverage.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented API endpoints — 5 new routes with OpenAPI spec and integration tests" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Code Review

After implementation, dispatch `code_review_team` for two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) before merging.
