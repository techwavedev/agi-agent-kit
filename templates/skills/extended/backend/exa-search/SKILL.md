# exa-search

## Overview
Semantic search, similar content discovery, and structured research using Exa API

## When to Use
- When you need semantic/embeddings-based search
- When finding similar content
- When searching by category (company, people, research papers, etc.)

## Installation
```bash
npx skills add -g BenedictKing/exa-search
```

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install the skill using the command above
2. Configure Exa API key
3. Use naturally in Claude Code conversations

## Examples
See [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BenedictKing/exa-search) for examples.

## Best Practices
- Configure API keys via environment variables

## Troubleshooting
See the GitHub repository for troubleshooting guides.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior API design decisions, database schema choices, and error handling patterns. Cache API response templates for consistent error formatting.

```bash
# Check for prior backend/API context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "API design patterns and architecture decisions for Exa Search"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store backend/API decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "API architecture: REST with HATEOAS, JWT auth, rate limiting at 100 req/min per tenant" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags exa-search backend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with frontend agents so they update their client code, and with QA agents for test coverage.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented API endpoints — 5 new routes with OpenAPI spec and integration tests" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Code Review

After implementation, dispatch `code_review_team` for two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) before merging.
