# exa-search

## Overview
Semantic search, similar content discovery, and structured research using Exa API

## When to Use
- When you need semantic/embeddings-based search
- When finding similar content
- When searching by category (company, people, research papers, etc.)

## Installation
```bash
npx skills add -g BenedictKing/exa-search
```

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install the skill using the command above
2. Configure Exa API key
3. Use naturally in Claude Code conversations

## Examples
See [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BenedictKing/exa-search) for examples.

## Best Practices
- Configure API keys via environment variables

## Troubleshooting
See the GitHub repository for troubleshooting guides.

## 🧠 AGI Framework Integration

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags exa-search <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
