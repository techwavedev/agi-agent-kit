# Async Python Patterns

Comprehensive guidance for implementing asynchronous Python applications using asyncio, concurrent programming patterns, and async/await for building high-performance, non-blocking systems.

## Use this skill when

- Building async web APIs (FastAPI, aiohttp, Sanic)
- Implementing concurrent I/O operations (database, file, network)
- Creating web scrapers with concurrent requests
- Developing real-time applications (WebSocket servers, chat systems)
- Processing multiple independent tasks simultaneously
- Building microservices with async communication
- Optimizing I/O-bound workloads
- Implementing async background tasks and queues

## Do not use this skill when

- The workload is CPU-bound with minimal I/O.
- A simple synchronous script is sufficient.
- The runtime environment cannot support asyncio/event loop usage.

## Instructions

- Clarify workload characteristics (I/O vs CPU), targets, and runtime constraints.
- Pick concurrency patterns (tasks, gather, queues, pools) with cancellation rules.
- Add timeouts, backpressure, and structured error handling.
- Include testing and debugging guidance for async code paths.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags async-python-patterns <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
