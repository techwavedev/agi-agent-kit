# Node.js Backend Patterns

Comprehensive guidance for building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready Node.js backend applications with modern frameworks, architectural patterns, and best practices.

## Use this skill when

- Building REST APIs or GraphQL servers
- Creating microservices with Node.js
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Designing scalable backend architectures
- Setting up middleware and error handling
- Integrating databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- Building real-time applications with WebSockets
- Implementing background job processing

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to node.js backend patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior API design decisions, database schema choices, and error handling patterns. Cache API response templates for consistent error formatting.

```bash
# Check for prior backend/API context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "API design patterns and architecture decisions for Nodejs Backend Patterns"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store backend/API decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "API architecture: REST with HATEOAS, JWT auth, rate limiting at 100 req/min per tenant" \
  --type decision --project <project> \
  --tags nodejs-backend-patterns backend
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Share API contract changes with frontend agents so they update their client code, and with QA agents for test coverage.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Implemented API endpoints — 5 new routes with OpenAPI spec and integration tests" \
  --project <project>
```

### Agent Team: Code Review

After implementation, dispatch `code_review_team` for two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) before merging.
