# Agent Manager Skill

## When to use

Use this skill when you need to:

- run multiple local CLI agents in parallel (separate tmux sessions)
- start/stop agents and tail their logs
- assign tasks to agents and monitor output
- schedule recurring agent work (cron)

## Prerequisites

Install `agent-manager-skill` in your workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fractalmind-ai/agent-manager-skill.git
```

## Common commands

```bash
python3 agent-manager/scripts/main.py doctor
python3 agent-manager/scripts/main.py list
python3 agent-manager/scripts/main.py start EMP_0001
python3 agent-manager/scripts/main.py monitor EMP_0001 --follow
python3 agent-manager/scripts/main.py assign EMP_0002 <<'EOF'
Follow teams/fractalmind-ai-maintenance.md Workflow
EOF
```

## Notes

- Requires `tmux` and `python3`.
- Agents are configured under an `agents/` directory (see the repo for examples).

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags agent-manager-skill <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
