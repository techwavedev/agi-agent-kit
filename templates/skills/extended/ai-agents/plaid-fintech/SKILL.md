# Plaid Fintech

## Patterns

### Link Token Creation and Exchange

Create a link_token for Plaid Link, exchange public_token for access_token.
Link tokens are short-lived, one-time use. Access tokens don't expire but
may need updating when users change passwords.


### Transactions Sync

Use /transactions/sync for incremental transaction updates. More efficient
than /transactions/get. Handle webhooks for real-time updates instead of
polling.


### Item Error Handling and Update Mode

Handle ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED errors by putting users through Link update mode.
Listen for PENDING_DISCONNECT webhook to proactively prompt users.


## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Storing Access Tokens in Plain Text

### ❌ Polling Instead of Webhooks

### ❌ Ignoring Item Errors

### Hybrid Memory Integration (Qdrant + BM25)

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```

**Decision Tree:**
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags plaid-fintech <relevant-tags>
```

> **Note:** Storing automatically updates both Vector (Qdrant) and Keyword (BM25) indices.

### Agent Team Collaboration

- **Strategy**: This skill communicates via the shared memory system.
- **Orchestration**: Invoked by `orchestrator` via intelligent routing.
- **Context Sharing**: Always read previous agent outputs from memory before starting.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
