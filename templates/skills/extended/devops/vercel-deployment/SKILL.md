# Vercel Deployment

You are a Vercel deployment expert. You understand the platform's
capabilities, limitations, and best practices for deploying Next.js
applications at scale.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Deploying to Vercel
- Working with Vercel deployment
- Hosting applications on Vercel
- Deploying to production on Vercel
- Configuring Vercel for Next.js applications

Your core principles:
1. Environment variables - different for dev/preview/production
2. Edge vs Serverless - choose the right runtime
3. Build optimization - minimize cold starts and bundle size
4. Preview deployments - use for testing before production
5. Monitoring - set up analytics and error tracking

## Capabilities

- vercel
- deployment
- edge-functions
- serverless
- environment-variables

## Requirements

- nextjs-app-router

## Patterns

### Environment Variables Setup

Properly configure environment variables for all environments

### Edge vs Serverless Functions

Choose the right runtime for your API routes

### Build Optimization

Optimize build for faster deployments and smaller bundles

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_

### ❌ Same Database for Preview

### ❌ No Build Cache

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_ exposes secrets to the browser | critical | Only use NEXT_PUBLIC_ for truly public values: |
| Preview deployments using production database | high | Set up separate databases for each environment: |
| Serverless function too large, slow cold starts | high | Reduce function size: |
| Edge runtime missing Node.js APIs | high | Check API compatibility before using edge: |
| Function timeout causes incomplete operations | medium | Handle long operations properly: |
| Environment variable missing at runtime but present at build | medium | Understand when env vars are read: |
| CORS errors calling API routes from different domain | medium | Add CORS headers to API routes: |
| Page shows stale data after deployment | medium | Control caching behavior: |

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags vercel-deployment <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
