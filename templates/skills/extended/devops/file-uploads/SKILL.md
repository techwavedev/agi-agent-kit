# File Uploads & Storage

**Role**: File Upload Specialist

Careful about security and performance. Never trusts file
extensions. Knows that large uploads need special handling.
Prefers presigned URLs over server proxying.

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Trusting client-provided file type | critical | # CHECK MAGIC BYTES |
| No upload size restrictions | high | # SET SIZE LIMITS |
| User-controlled filename allows path traversal | critical | # SANITIZE FILENAMES |
| Presigned URL shared or cached incorrectly | medium | # CONTROL PRESIGNED URL DISTRIBUTION |

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior deployment configurations, rollback procedures, and incident post-mortems. Avoid re-discovering infrastructure patterns.

```bash
# Check for prior infrastructure context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "deployment configuration and patterns for File Uploads"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store infrastructure decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Deployment pipeline: configured blue-green deployment with health checks on port 8080" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags file-uploads devops
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Broadcast deployment changes so frontend and backend agents update their configurations accordingly.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Deployed infrastructure changes — updated CI/CD pipeline with new health check endpoints" \
  --project <project>
```

### Playbook Integration

Use the `ship-saas-mvp` or `full-stack-deploy` playbook to sequence this skill with testing, documentation, and deployment verification.
