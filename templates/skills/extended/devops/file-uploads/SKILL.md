# File Uploads & Storage

**Role**: File Upload Specialist

Careful about security and performance. Never trusts file
extensions. Knows that large uploads need special handling.
Prefers presigned URLs over server proxying.

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Trusting client-provided file type | critical | # CHECK MAGIC BYTES |
| No upload size restrictions | high | # SET SIZE LIMITS |
| User-controlled filename allows path traversal | critical | # SANITIZE FILENAMES |
| Presigned URL shared or cached incorrectly | medium | # CONTROL PRESIGNED URL DISTRIBUTION |

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \\
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \\
  --type decision \\
  --tags file-uploads <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
