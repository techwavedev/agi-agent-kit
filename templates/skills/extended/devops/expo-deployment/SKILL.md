# Expo Deployment

## Overview

Deploy Expo applications to production environments, including app stores and over-the-air updates.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to deploy Expo apps to production.

Use this skill when:
- Deploying Expo apps to production
- Publishing to app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- Setting up over-the-air (OTA) updates
- Configuring production build settings
- Managing release channels and versions

## Instructions

This skill provides guidance for deploying Expo apps:

1. **Build Configuration**: Set up production build settings
2. **App Store Submission**: Prepare and submit to app stores
3. **OTA Updates**: Configure over-the-air update channels
4. **Release Management**: Manage versions and release channels
5. **Production Optimization**: Optimize apps for production

## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update version numbers
3. Configure production environment variables
4. Review and optimize app bundle size
5. Test production builds locally

### App Store Deployment

1. Build production binaries (iOS/Android)
2. Configure app store metadata
3. Submit to App Store Connect / Google Play Console
4. Manage app store listings and screenshots
5. Handle app review process

### OTA Updates

1. Configure update channels (production, staging, etc.)
2. Build and publish updates
3. Manage rollout strategies
4. Monitor update adoption
5. Handle rollbacks if needed

## Best Practices

- Use EAS Build for reliable production builds
- Test production builds before submission
- Implement proper error tracking and analytics
- Use release channels for staged rollouts
- Keep app store metadata up to date
- Monitor app performance in production

## AGI Framework Integration

### Memory-First Protocol

Retrieve prior deployment configurations, rollback procedures, and incident post-mortems. Avoid re-discovering infrastructure patterns.

```bash
# Check for prior infrastructure context before starting
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "deployment configuration and patterns for Expo Deployment"
```

### Storing Results

After completing work, store infrastructure decisions for future sessions:

```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Deployment pipeline: configured blue-green deployment with health checks on port 8080" \
  --type technical --project <project> \
  --tags expo-deployment devops
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Broadcast deployment changes so frontend and backend agents update their configurations accordingly.

```bash
python3 execution/cross_agent_context.py store \
  --agent "<your-agent>" \
  --action "Deployed infrastructure changes — updated CI/CD pipeline with new health check endpoints" \
  --project <project>
```

### Playbook Integration

Use the `ship-saas-mvp` or `full-stack-deploy` playbook to sequence this skill with testing, documentation, and deployment verification.
