# Kubernetes Manifest Generator

Step-by-step guidance for creating production-ready Kubernetes manifests including Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create new Kubernetes Deployment manifests
- Define Service resources for network connectivity
- Generate ConfigMap and Secret resources for configuration management
- Create PersistentVolumeClaim manifests for stateful workloads
- Follow Kubernetes best practices and naming conventions
- Implement resource limits, health checks, and security contexts
- Design manifests for multi-environment deployments

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to kubernetes manifest generator
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Qdrant Memory Integration

Before executing complex tasks with this skill:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py auto --query "<task summary>"
```
- **Cache hit?** Use cached response directly — no need to re-process.
- **Memory match?** Inject `context_chunks` into your reasoning.
- **No match?** Proceed normally, then store results:
```bash
python3 execution/memory_manager.py store \
  --content "Description of what was decided/solved" \
  --type decision \
  --tags k8s-manifest-generator <relevant-tags>
```

### Agent Team Collaboration

- This skill can be invoked by the `orchestrator` agent via intelligent routing.
- In **Agent Teams mode**, results are shared via Qdrant shared memory for cross-agent context.
- In **Subagent mode**, this skill runs in isolation with its own memory namespace.

### Local LLM Support

When available, use local Ollama models for embedding and lightweight inference:
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text` via Qdrant memory system
- Lightweight analysis: Local models reduce API costs for repetitive patterns
