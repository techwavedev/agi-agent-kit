# Multi-Agent Orchestration

> Platform-adaptive parallel agent coordination

## Overview

This skill enables coordinating multiple specialized agents across different AI platforms. It automatically detects the runtime environment and selects the best orchestration strategy:

| Platform                              | Strategy            | Parallelism         | Mechanism                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Claude Code** (with Agent Teams)    | Native Agent Teams  | ✅ True parallel    | tmux/in-process sessions       |
| **Claude Code** (without Agent Teams) | Subagents           | ✅ Background tasks | `Task()` tool, `context: fork` |
| **Gemini / Antigravity**              | Sequential Personas | ❌ Sequential       | Persona switching via `@agent` |
| **Opencode / Other**                  | Sequential Personas | ❌ Sequential       | Persona switching via `@agent` |

---

## Platform Detection

Before orchestrating, detect the current platform:

```
IF environment has CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
  → Use Agent Teams (Strategy A)
ELSE IF environment is Claude Code (has Task tool, /agents command)
  → Use Subagents (Strategy B)
ELSE
  → Use Sequential Personas (Strategy C)
```

> **Important**: Always announce which strategy is being used so the user knows what to expect.

---

## Strategy A: Claude Code Agent Teams (Preferred)

> **Requires**: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings or environment.

Agent Teams spawn **true parallel Claude Code sessions** as teammates. Each teammate runs in its own context with full tool access.

### Enabling Agent Teams

Users must enable via `settings.json` or environment:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
```

### How to Orchestrate with Agent Teams

**The lead agent (you) acts as Team Leader.** When a complex multi-domain task is detected:

1. **Analyze** the task and identify independent work streams
2. **Spawn teammates** with clear, self-contained prompts
3. **Assign tasks** to each teammate
4. **Monitor** progress and steer if needed
5. **Synthesize** results when teammates complete

#### Spawn a Team

```
Create an agent team with 3 teammates:
- "security-reviewer": Review the auth module at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling and session management.
- "api-specialist": Analyze the API layer at src/api/ for best practices, error handling, and performance.
- "test-engineer": Identify test gaps across the project, focus on untested edge cases.

Use Sonnet for each teammate.
```

#### Team Display Modes

| Mode            | How                                            | Best For          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **In-process**  | All in one terminal. `Shift+Up/Down` to switch | Simple setups     |
| **Split panes** | Each gets own tmux/iTerm2 pane                 | Visual monitoring |

```json
{ "teammateMode": "in-process" }
```

#### Team Communication

- **Message teammate**: Tell the lead to message a specific teammate
- **Broadcast**: Send to all teammates (use sparingly — costs scale)
- **Task list**: Shared task board visible to all agents (`Ctrl+T`)
- **Idle notifications**: Teammates auto-notify lead when done

#### Quality Gates via Hooks

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "TeammateIdle": [
      { "command": "npm test", "description": "Run tests before idle" }
    ],
    "TaskCompleted": [
      { "command": "./scripts/lint.sh", "description": "Lint on completion" }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Cleanup

```
Clean up the team
```

### Agent Teams Best Practices

1. **Give enough context** — teammates don't share the lead's full conversation
2. **Size tasks well** — not too small (overhead), not too large (risk)
3. **Avoid file conflicts** — assign non-overlapping file sets to each teammate
4. **Wait before synthesizing** — let all teammates finish before combining results
5. **Start with research** — use research/review tasks before implementation tasks

---

## Strategy B: Claude Code Subagents (Fallback on Claude Code)

> When Agent Teams aren't enabled on Claude Code, use **subagents** for parallel work.

Subagents are isolated Claude Code sessions spawned via the `Task` tool. They can run in **foreground** (blocking) or **background** (concurrent).

### Built-in Subagents

| Agent               | Model    | Purpose                        |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Explore**         | Haiku    | Fast read-only codebase search |
| **Plan**            | Inherits | Research during plan mode      |
| **General-purpose** | Inherits | Complex multi-step operations  |

### Custom Subagents

Define in `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: security-reviewer
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
permissionMode: acceptEdits
skills:
  - vulnerability-scanner
memory: project
---

You are a security reviewer. Analyze code for vulnerabilities, focusing on:

- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Input validation issues
- Secret exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

Report with severity ratings. Check your memory for patterns seen before.
```

### Invoking Subagents

**Foreground** (blocking):

```
Use the security-reviewer subagent to audit the authentication module
```

**Background** (concurrent):

```
Run the security-reviewer subagent in the background to audit auth while I continue working
```

**Parallel research**:

```
Research the authentication, database, and API modules in parallel using separate subagents
```

**Chaining**:

```
Use the code-reviewer subagent to find issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### Restricting Subagent Spawning

A coordinator can restrict which subagents it spawns:

```markdown
---
name: coordinator
description: Coordinates work across specialized agents
tools: Task(worker, researcher), Read, Bash
---
```

This coordinator can only spawn `worker` and `researcher` subagents.

---

## Strategy C: Sequential Personas (Universal Fallback)

> For Gemini, Opencode, and other platforms without native agent parallelism.

### How It Works

The AI adopts different specialist personas sequentially, passing context between phases:

```
🤖 Applying knowledge of @security-auditor...
[Security analysis]

🤖 Applying knowledge of @backend-specialist...
[API analysis, informed by security findings]

🤖 Applying knowledge of @test-engineer...
[Test gap analysis, informed by both previous analyses]
```

### Native Agent Invocation

**Single Agent:**

```
Use the security-auditor agent to review authentication
```

**Sequential Chain:**

```
First, use the explorer-agent to discover project structure.
Then, use the backend-specialist to review API endpoints.
Finally, use the test-engineer to identify test gaps.
```

**With Context Passing:**

```
Use the frontend-specialist to analyze React components.
Based on those findings, have the test-engineer generate component tests.
```

## Orchestration Patterns (Platform-Independent)

These patterns work across all strategies. The platform dictates whether they run in parallel or sequentially.

### Pattern 1: Comprehensive Analysis

```
Agents: explorer → [domain-agents] → synthesis

1. explorer-agent: Map codebase structure
2. security-auditor: Security posture
3. backend-specialist: API quality
4. frontend-specialist: UI/UX patterns
5. test-engineer: Test coverage
6. Synthesize all findings
```

**On Claude Code Agent Teams**: Steps 2-5 run as parallel teammates
**On Claude Code Subagents**: Steps 2-5 run as background subagents
**On Other Platforms**: Steps 1-5 run sequentially with context passing

### Pattern 2: Feature Review

```
Agents: affected-domain-agents → test-engineer

1. Identify affected domains (backend? frontend? both?)
2. Invoke relevant domain agents
3. test-engineer verifies changes
4. Synthesize recommendations
```

### Pattern 3: Security Audit

```
Agents: security-auditor → penetration-tester → synthesis

1. security-auditor: Configuration and code review
2. penetration-tester: Active vulnerability testing
3. Synthesize with prioritized remediation
```

### Pattern 4: Cross-Layer Feature Implementation

```
Agents: database-architect → backend-specialist → frontend-specialist → test-engineer

1. database-architect: Schema changes
2. backend-specialist: API endpoints
3. frontend-specialist: UI components
4. test-engineer: Full-stack tests
```

**On Agent Teams**: Split into backend teammate + frontend teammate + test teammate

## Synthesis Protocol

After all agents/teammates complete, synthesize:

```markdown
## Orchestration Synthesis

### Task Summary

[What was accomplished]

### Strategy Used

[Agent Teams / Subagents / Sequential — and why]

### Agent Contributions

| Agent              | Finding      |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| security-auditor   | Found X      |
| backend-specialist | Identified Y |

### Consolidated Recommendations

1. **Critical**: [Issue from Agent A]
2. **Important**: [Issue from Agent B]
3. **Nice-to-have**: [Enhancement from Agent C]

### Action Items

- [ ] Fix critical security issue
- [ ] Refactor API endpoint
- [ ] Add missing tests
```

## Best Practices

1. **Platform-first** — Always use the highest-capability strategy available
2. **Announce strategy** — Tell the user which orchestration mode is being used
3. **Logical order** — Discovery → Analysis → Implementation → Testing
4. **Share context** — Pass relevant findings between agents/teammates
5. **Single synthesis** — One unified report, not separate outputs
6. **Verify changes** — Always include test-engineer for code modifications
7. **Avoid file conflicts** — Assign non-overlapping file scopes to parallel agents
