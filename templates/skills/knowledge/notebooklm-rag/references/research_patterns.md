# Research Patterns Reference

## Pattern 1: Exhaustive Topic Extraction

Query a notebook repeatedly with increasingly specific questions to build a
comprehensive knowledge map of a topic.

```
Step 1: "What are the main topics covered in this notebook?"
Step 2: "Tell me everything about [Topic A]"
Step 3: "What specific details, examples, or data points exist for [Topic A]?"
Step 4: Repeat for each topic
```

## Pattern 2: Comparative Analysis

Use parallel queries to compare how different sources treat the same subject.

```
Step 1: "What does [Source A] say about [topic]?"
Step 2: "What does [Source B] say about [topic]?"
Step 3: "Where do the sources agree and disagree on [topic]?"
```

## Pattern 3: Decision Support

Extract decision-relevant information from documents to support a specific choice.

```
Step 1: "What options for [decision] are discussed in the documents?"
Step 2: "What are the pros and cons of each option?"
Step 3: "What constraints or requirements are mentioned?"
Step 4: "Is there a recommended approach? What evidence supports it?"
```

## Pattern 4: Compliance Audit

Systematically verify document coverage against a checklist.

```
Step 1: Define checklist items
Step 2: For each item: "Does the documentation address [checklist item]?"
Step 3: Flag items with no coverage
Step 4: Report compliance percentage and gaps
```
