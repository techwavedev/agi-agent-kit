# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Contextual AGI Integration Blocks (1,200 Extended Skills)** — Updated all 1,200 extended skills in `templates/skills/extended/` with contextually adapted AGI Framework Integration blocks. Each block is tailored to the skill's domain and includes: Memory-First Protocol (skill-specific Qdrant query examples), Storing Results (concrete domain-relevant examples), Multi-Agent Collaboration (skill-specific cross-agent context sharing), and a 4th domain-specific section (e.g., Token Versioning for design-system, Brand Source of Truth for brand, Signed Audit Trail for security, Playbook Integration for devops).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Distributed Agent Authentication** — Replaced local SQLite auth storage with shared Qdrant `agent_auth` collection. Identities, access grants, content hashes, and audit trails are now distributed across all agents sharing a Qdrant instance. 8 payload indexes for efficient filtering. Deterministic UUIDs for idempotent operations. (36/36 tests)
- **Hyperledger Aries Integration** — Replaced deprecated MultiChain with Hyperledger Aries ACA-Py 1.5.0 (OpenWallet Foundation). W3C DID identity, Ed25519 signing, official Docker image (`ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/acapy-agent:1.5.0`). Optional add-on — HMAC-SHA256 works without Aries.
- **Memory Mode Tiers** — Three operational modes (`MEMORY_MODE`): Solo (single user), Team (multi-tenancy with developer isolation), Pro (blockchain auth + access control). All backward-compatible, no data migration needed.
- **Real-Time Agent Events** — Apache Pulsar event bus for push notifications between agents. Auto-publishes on `memory_manager.py store` (team/pro modes). 9 event types. Project-scoped topics (`persistent://agi/memory/<project>`). Graceful degradation when Pulsar unavailable. (19/19 tests)
- **BM25 Auto-Sync on Boot** — `session_boot.py` now automatically syncs the local BM25 keyword index from shared Qdrant data, ensuring every machine has consistent hybrid search results.
- **Docker Compose for Pulsar** — `docker-compose.pulsar.yml` with `apachepulsar/pulsar:4.1.3`, lightweight standalone mode (256-512MB heap), health checks.
- **Docker Compose for Aries** — `docker-compose.aries.yml` with official ACA-Py 1.5.0 image, wallet configuration.

### Changed

- **`blockchain_auth.py`** — Complete rewrite: `QdrantAuthStore` replaces SQLite, `AriesClient` replaces MultiChain. All auth data stored in shared Qdrant collection.
- **`session_boot.py`** — Now reports Pulsar status, Aries status, and BM25 sync results. Auto-syncs BM25 from Qdrant on every boot.
- **`memory_manager.py`** — Auto-publishes Pulsar events on store (team/pro). Health check includes events status.
- **`session_init.py`** — Creates `agent_auth` Qdrant collection with 4-dimensional vectors and 8 payload indexes.

### Documentation

- **`docs/memory-modes.md`** — Complete rewrite. Why each mode, when to use, scenario comparisons, data storage table. Every feature verified with test evidence.
- **`docs/blockchain-auth.md`** — Complete rewrite. Technology comparison (MultiChain vs Ethereum vs Aries), Qdrant vs SQLite rationale, trust model diagram, all CLI commands verified.
- **`docs/agent-events.md`** — Complete rewrite. Pulsar vs Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka comparison, verified capabilities table, corrected dependency requirements.

### Removed

- **MultiChain** — Deprecated (last commit 2023, no maintained Docker image). Replaced by Hyperledger Aries.
- **SQLite auth storage** — Replaced by shared Qdrant `agent_auth` collection for distributed consistency.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Blockchain Agent Identity & Write Signing (Phase 1)** — Each agent gets an Ed25519 keypair on first boot (`~/.agi-agent-kit/identity/`). All Qdrant writes (memory + cache) are automatically signed with `_signature`, `_agent_id`, `_content_hash` fields. Zero performance impact on reads; signing adds <1ms to writes. Graceful degradation if `cryptography` package is not installed.
  - `execution/agent_identity.py` — keypair generation, signing, verification CLI
  - `execution/chain_anchor.py` — async MultiChain hash anchoring with local JSONL queue fallback
  - New dependency: `cryptography`

- **Control Tower Orchestrator** — Central dispatcher tracking all active agents, sub-agents, teams, and LLMs across machines. Commands: `register`, `heartbeat`, `status`, `assign`, `reassign`, `dashboard`. Auto-registers on `session_boot.py` startup.
  - `execution/control_tower.py`
  - `directives/control_tower.md`

- **Cross-Agent Collaboration** — Multi-LLM context sharing via Qdrant. Agents (Claude, Antigravity/Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, OpenCode, OpenClaw) share decisions, handoffs, and broadcasts through `execution/cross_agent_context.py`. Added `sync`, `pending`, `store`, `handoff`, `broadcast`, and `status` commands.

- **Framework Self-Development Infrastructure** — Full dogfooding layer for developing the public framework using its own 3-layer architecture:
  - Directives: `framework_development.md`, `template_sync.md`, `skill_development.md`, `multi_llm_collaboration.md`, `memory_integration.md`, `release_process.md`
  - Execution scripts: `sync_to_template.py` (drift detection + sync), `validate_template.py` (template integrity)
  - Agent Teams: `documentation_team`, `code_review_team`, `qa_team`, `build_deploy_team` with 8 sub-agent directives
  - Skill Creator toolkit: `init_skill.py`, `package_skill.py`, `quick_validate.py`, `update_catalog.py`

- **Upstream Sync Skill** — `skills/upstream-sync/` with `sync_upstream.py` and `upstream_registry.json` for pulling updates from forked skill sources

- **Upstream Sync: antigravity-awesome-skills** — Synced latest from `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` via `skill-adapt` strategy. 406 new skills added, 756 updated with preserved AGI integration blocks. New skills include: `explain-like-socrates`, `ai-md`, `yes-md`, `local-llm-expert`, `keyword-extractor`, and 400+ more across all categories. Total extended skills: 1,181.

- **Upstream Sync: superpowers v5.0.1** — Synced 14 skills from `obra/superpowers` via `skill-diff` strategy: `brainstorming`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `executing-plans`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `receiving-code-review`, `requesting-code-review`, `subagent-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`, `using-superpowers`, `verification-before-completion`, `writing-plans`, `writing-skills`. All adapted with Qdrant hybrid memory integration.

- **Upstream Sync: ui-ux-pro-max** — Full-replace sync from `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`. 319 files synced including new `slides` skill (HTML presentations with Chart.js), `banner-design` skill (22 styles, multi-platform), `logo` generation (55 styles, Gemini AI), `icon` design (15 styles, SVG), `social-photos` (HTML-to-screenshot), corporate identity program (CIP), and expanded Google Fonts collection with Chinese-to-English translations.

- **Upstream Sync: Yuan3.0** — Reference-only inspection of `Yuan-lab-LLM/Yuan3.0` (8,804 files). Yuan3.0 MoE 40B model with RAPO reinforcement learning. No direct skill mapping — used as research reference for MoE/RAPO patterns.

- **Skills Catalog** — `skills/SKILLS_CATALOG.md` — complete auto-generated catalog of all installed skills

- **Workflow Playbooks Data** — `data/workflows.json` with guided multi-skill sequences

- **Contextual AGI Integration Blocks** — Replaced generic copy-paste AGI blocks across all 1,184 extended skills with domain-specific content. 16 category templates (security, architecture, testing, debugging, AI agents, DevOps, frontend, backend, workflow, documentation, data, content, mobile, blockchain, gaming, default) each showing real framework features relevant to that skill's domain — signed audit trails for security, TDD enforcement for testing, BM25 exact match for debugging, Control Tower for architecture, etc. Added `scripts/contextualize_agi_blocks.py` for future upstream sync re-runs.

### Changed

- **Session Boot** — Now checks/generates agent identity (Step 2.5) and auto-registers with Control Tower (Step 4). Reports `agent_id` in summary output.
- **Memory Writes** — `store_memory()` and `store_response()` return `signed` and `agent_id` fields indicating cryptographic signing status.
- **AGENTS.md** — Added cross-agent collaboration section and framework self-development documentation. Symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` for cross-agent instruction sharing.
- **Roadmap** — Added: Blockchain Agent Trust & Tenancy (design), Apache Pulsar streaming (design), Control Tower Orchestrator (active), Secrets Management via Vault (design).
- **Upstream Sync Script** — Fixed `PROJECT_ROOT` resolution in `sync_upstream.py` (was resolving to `skills/` instead of repo root, causing `adapt_script_missing` errors).

### Security

- **CodeQL CWE-20 Fix** — Replaced URL substring checks with `urlparse` hostname comparison to prevent incomplete URL sanitization (`46739fc`)
- **Workflow Permissions** — Added explicit least-privilege permissions to `publish.yml` and `virustotal.yml` workflows (`70715d4`)
- **CVE-2026-27606** — Updated rollup in todo app example to resolve dependency vulnerability (`34b28d1`)
- **VirusTotal Action** — Bumped `crazy-max/ghaction-virustotal` from v4 to v5

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **`system_checkup.py` missing after full install** — The script was accidentally removed during the v1.2.7 repository sanitization (`c564459`). Restored `system_checkup.py` to `templates/base/execution/` so `npx init` correctly copies it into new projects. Running `python3 execution/system_checkup.py --verbose` now works as documented.
- **`hybrid_search.py` incorrect path in documentation** — README, README.pt-BR, `directives/memory_integration.md`, and `qdrant-memory/references/complete_guide.md` all referenced `scripts/hybrid_search.py`, which does not exist. Corrected all 6 occurrences to the actual path: `skills/qdrant-memory/scripts/hybrid_search.py`.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Portuguese Localization** — Added `README.pt-BR.md` to support Brazilian Portuguese speakers.
- **UI UX Pro Max Prompts** — Expanded the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill with proven structural and stylistic prompt examples (SaaS, Educational, Pet Grooming, AI Chatbot).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **UI UX Pro Max v2.0** — Upgraded design intelligence skill with major enhancements:
  - **Design System Generator** — AI-powered reasoning engine that analyzes project requirements and generates complete, tailored design systems (pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, anti-patterns)
  - **100 Industry-Specific Reasoning Rules** — Automated style/color/typography selection based on product type and industry
  - **Expanded Data** — 67 UI styles (was 50), 96 color palettes (was 21), 57 font pairings (was 50), 25 chart types (was 20), 13 tech stacks (was 9), 99 UX guidelines
  - **Persist Design System** — Master + Overrides pattern for hierarchical retrieval across sessions (`--persist` flag)
  - **Qdrant Memory Integration** — Design decisions automatically stored and retrieved for project continuity
  - **SKILLS_CATALOG.md** — Updated `ui-ux-pro-max` description to reflect v2.0 capabilities

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Smart Init Wizard** — Complete overhaul of `npx init` with a guided, step-by-step setup experience:
  - **Existing install detection** — Reads `.agi-version` stamp; offers `Update` (preserve `.env`), `Reinstall` (full overwrite), or `Cancel`. Shows installed vs incoming version with downgrade warning.
  - **Install scope prompt** — Choose between project-local (current dir) or global (`~/.agent` + platform symlinks) with a compatibility table and pitfalls disclaimer.
  - **Smart backup** — Scans files that would be overwritten before touching anything. For global installs, also detects real platform dirs that would be replaced by symlinks. Saves timestamped backup.
  - **Custom domain pack selection** — New `4. custom` option shows all 15 skill domains with ■ professional and ■ community skill counts, supports comma/range multi-select (`1,3,7-9`, `all`).
  - **Service-aware memory setup** — Detects Ollama, Docker, and Qdrant before asking. If a service is missing, asks whether it's not installed yet (shows install link) or running on a custom URL (prompts for URL + API key, verifies connectivity).
  - **Agent Teams prompt** — Explicit opt-in to `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` with explanation and safe merge into `.claude/settings.json`.
  - **Uninstall script** — Global installs generate `~/.agent/uninstall-agi.sh`, a ready-to-run script that removes all symlinks and the install directory.
  - **Version stamp** — Writes `.agi-version` after every install/update.
  - **Configurable final summary** — Shows exactly what was configured (memory, Agent Teams, MCP) and what manual steps remain (plugins, MCP servers).

### Changed

- **`verifyMemorySetup()`** — Now returns `true`/`false` so the final message correctly shows "Memory is READY" vs "start services" only when relevant.
- **`writeEnvFile()`** — Now writes the actual Qdrant URL, Ollama URL, and API key entered during setup instead of always defaulting to localhost.
- **`copySkills()`** — Refactored to share a helper. Custom pack installs core first then resolves each selected domain from both `knowledge/` and `extended/` tiers.
- **Platform setup** (`runPlatformSetup`) — Now runs _after_ the new `promptPlatformFeatures` step so user intent is captured before platform scripts apply settings.

### Fixed

- **Next steps message** — No longer suggests starting services when they were already verified during install.
- **`memoryVerified` bug** — Was referenced but never assigned; `verifyMemorySetup()` return value is now captured.
